            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                For tens of thousands of San Franciscans, the 38-Geary bus is an institution. It's the primary transit
                artery for the entire northwestern side of the city, connecting some of the city's busiest neighborhoods
                to downtown. The Geary corridor was once the home to San Francisco's first streetcar in 1912, the A and
                B lines. These lines were decomissioned in 1956 and replaced by the 38-Geary bus line. This project asks
                a simple question: Is a bus line enough for a corridor of this magnitude?
            </p>
            <p>
                The title of this project, "44,000 Riders, Zero Trains," is the conclusion I reached after a deep-dive
                analysis of the data. This project makes the data-driven case that the Geary corridor has long outgrown
                its bus-only infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evidence will show that Geary's combination of high population density, high resident transit
                dependency, and massive ridership demand makes it the most underserved transit corridor in
                San Francisco.

            <h2>The Map: A Dense and Transit-Dependent "Rail Desert"</h2>
            <p>
                The first step in making the case for a new subway is to understand where people live and how they get
                around. Using data from <a
                    href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US06075012502-census-tract-12502-san-francisco-ca">Census
                    Reporter</a>, <a
                    href="https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Map-of-Muni-Simple-Routes/ubh8-p5ug">DataSF</a>, and <a
                    href="https://www.bart.gov/schedules/developers/geo">BART</a> this interactive map visualizes two
                key stories for San Francisco's census tracts.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, the map shows population density. The story is immediately clear, the bright red/orange
                spine running through the northwestern part of the city into downtown is the Geary corridor, one of the
                densest population centers in all of San Francisco.
            </p>
            <p>
                Clicking the "Equity" toggle will switch to an equity map, showing the
                percentage of households in each tract that have zero vehicles. We can see that the same
                dense corridor is also home to thousands of households that are highly transit-dependent.

            <p>
                From this map we can see just how barren the northwestern side of the city is. Other dense corridors
                such as Market Street and Mission Street are served by both Muni and BART. In stark contrast, the Geary
                corridor is left with just the 38-Geary, a single line struggling to its growing demand.

        <section id="ridership-analysis" class="project-section">
            <h2>Ridership: The #1 Most Underserved Corridor</h2>
            <p>
                The map gave us a better understanding of where people live, this chart quantifies how many of them are
                on transit.
            </p>
            <p>
                To create a true apples-to-apples comparison, this chart groups major bus routes into the corridors they
                serve. Crucially, it combines the ridership of the 14-Mission and 14R-Mission Rapid into a single
                "Mission Corridor" and adds the ridership from the two BART stations (16th & 24th St.) that serve it.
                The data for this graph was sourced from <a
                    href="https://www.sfmta.com/reports/average-daily-muni-boardings-route-and-month-pre-pandemic-present">SFMTA</a>
                and <a href="https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership">BART</a>.
            </p>
            <div id="chart-container">
                <svg id="ridership-chart"></svg>
            </div>
            <p>
                The data is staggering. The Mission corridor serves 46,230 people daily. That number is not even
                including the BART ridership and 49 Van Ness/Mission, that both partially serve the Mission corridor.
                All together they have 93,960 daily riders, appropriately served by three major bus lines and a
                heavy-rail subway.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Geary corridor is also in a league of its own as the clear #2 when it comes to bus demand, with over
                44,000 daily riders. Despite its clear #2 status Geary does not have any form of rail along its corridor
                whatsoever unlike the Mission corridor. Geary's massive, bus-only demand is a clear indication that rail
                would be beneficial for this corridor.

        <section id="ridership-trends" class="project-section">
            <h2>Trends: A Strong and Resilient Demand</h2>
            <p>
                A common counter-argument to new transit projects in the U.S. is the post-pandemic decline in ridership.
                The chart below addresses that concern directly by tracking the average weekday ridership for San
                Francisco's busiest bus corridors from 2019 to 2025 with data provided by <a
                    href="https://www.sfmta.com/reports/average-daily-muni-boardings-route-and-month-pre-pandemic-present">SFMTA</a>.
            </p>
            <div id="line-chart-container">
                <svg id="ridership-line-chart"></svg>
            </div>
            <p>
                In 2019, the Geary Corridor (blue) was in a class of its own, leading all other bus corridors with over
                53,000 daily riders. While it has fallen to the 2nd most ridden bus corridor, it is on pace to reclaim
                its throne as the busiest bus corridor in San Francisco.
            </p>
            <p>
                This chart proves that the demand on Geary is not a temporary spike, it is a permanent and resilient
                feature of the city's transit landscape. The 44,000+ daily riders are not an anomaly, they are part of a
                strong recovery back to a pre-pandemic norm that was already overwhelming for a bus-only system.

        <section id="crowding-analysis" class="project-section">
            <h2>Crowding: A System at Its Breaking Point</h2>
            <p>
                The previous charts established that the Geary corridor has massive, resilient demand. This
                visualization aims to answer the most important question, "so what?"
            </p>
            <p>
                The data for this graph is once again from <a
                    href="https://www.sfmta.com/reports/percent-daily-muni-trips-crowded-route-and-month">SFMTA</a>.
                Crowded is defined as when "vehicles are above capacity for 10% or more of the stops."
                This chart illustrates the human cost of that demand, the passenger "pain point." It shows the Max Peak
                Crowding for the city's top 15 bus routes, calculated by finding the average percentage of trips that
                are at the official crowding threshold during their single busiest commute (either AM inbound or PM
                outbound).
            </p>
            <div id="crowding-chart-container">
                <svg id="crowding-chart"></svg>
            </div>
            <p>
                The 38R Geary Rapid is the 3rd most crowded route in all of San Francisco, with over 21% of its
                peak-commute trips being over capacity. This proves that the current bus system is failing to meet
                the corridor's immense demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Geary subway could help alleviate this strain on the 38 bus line while also relieving some stress from
                the 1-California line too. The 1-California and 38-Geary are both East-West running lines that have a
                lot amongst
                overlap for the communities they serve.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusion" class="project-section">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>When viewed together the data provides an undeniable story.</p>
            <p>
                First, the <a href="#density-map">Density & Equity Map</a> established a clear geospatial problem, a
                "rail desert" in the
                northwestern quadrant of the city, which is simultaneously one of the densest and most transit-dependent
                areas in San Francisco yet to be served by rail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, the <a href="#ridership-analysis">Ridership Analysis</a> quantified this problem. It proved that
                the Geary corridor is the #1 most
                underserved
                corridor in the city. Its 44,250 daily bus-only riders rivals the Mission corridor, but unlike the
                Mission corridor it isn't also served by a rail line.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, the <a href="#ridership-trends">Ridership Trends</a> chart rebutted any counter-arguments about
                the pandemic. It showed that
                Geary's massive demand is not a temporary spike, it's a resilient, structural trend that was massive
                pre-pandemic (53,000+ daily riders) and is recovering fast and will soon reach or even surpass its
                pre-pandemic demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the <a href="#crowding-analysis">Crowding Analysis</a> provided the "smoking gun." The 38R Geary
                Rapid is one of the top 3 most
                crowded bus lines in the city, proving that the current infrastructure is at its breaking point and is
                failing to provide adequate service for its passengers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The 38-Geary is not just a "busy bus line." The data proves it's a high-capacity rail line in disguise,
                forced to operate with the infrastructure of a local route. The conclusion is clear, the 44,250 daily
                riders and the thousands more who are discouraged by the current system's crowding are being
                underserved. This isn't just an inconvenience, it's an equity issue. The data shows the demand is
                there, the demand is resilient, and the current system is failing. The best time to build the subway was
                50 years ago. The second-best time is now. It's time to build the subway, it's time for the <a
                    href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/today-history-geary-then-and-now">B-Geary</a> to
                run along Geary once again.
